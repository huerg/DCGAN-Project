# DCGAN-Project

In this project a DCGAN will be implemented for the purpose of generation low resolution faces. It is planned to gradually further develop this model to approximate the [U-Net Based Discriminator for Generative Adversarial Networks of Sch√∂nfeld et. al.](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Schonfeld_A_U-Net_Based_Discriminator_for_Generative_Adversarial_Networks_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf).
